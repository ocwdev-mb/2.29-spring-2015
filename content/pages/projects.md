There will be a final project for this class. Students can select the topic of their project in consultation with the instructor. Possible projects include:

1.  Comprehensive reviews of material not covered in detail in class, with some numerical examples;
2.  Specific fluid-related problems or questions that are numerically studied or solved by the applications of approaches, methods or schemes covered in class;
3.  A combination of 1) and 2).

Projects will be due at the end of term. There will be a final session where all students will make a presentation of their projects to the whole class and staff. We have found that such presentations provide an excellent means for additional learning and sharing.

These are the titles of the student project presentations:
